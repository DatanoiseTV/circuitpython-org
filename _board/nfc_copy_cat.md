NFC Copy Cat, manufactured by Electronic Cats, is a small device that combines two powerful cybersecurity tools, NFCopy and MagSpoof. NFCopy works by reading or emulating a NFC card; depending on the necessities of the researcher. On the other hand, MagSpoof can wirelessly emulate/spoof any magnetic stripe card. So using NFC Copy Cat, the user will have a device capable of storing magnetic stripe data or NFC payment data to be replayed later â€” known in the cybersecurity world as a replay attack.
