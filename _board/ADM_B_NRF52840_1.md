The ADM_52840 is a Breakout board to test an NRF52840 module from HolyIOT. Nothing very difficult, apart from the soldering part which requires a stencil in order to solder all the pads of the module. However, since internal pads are routed using vias, it's possible to solder them all with a good soldering iron. It requires a J-link type programmer. An ST-Link V2 should be suitable or the J-Link of Nordic DK boards.
