Advanced Design Technology provides technology to major companies based on the development and design of integrated circuits such as LSI and FPGA. "Potekku" also utilizes this know-how to provide a curriculum that specializes in manufacturing.

This time, the pre-launch will start for the March launch of "COSMO Editor", which provides the curriculum on-demand delivery.

"COSMO Editor" is a tool that covers AI / IoT development for children who have never touched a PC and people who want to practice making gadgets.

At the same time, the pre-launch of the board "COSMO Pico", which is suitable for manufacturing and programming learning and has the same CPU as the learning board "Raspberry pi pico", will also start. By using it together with "COSMO Pico", you can make the most of "COSMO Editor", making it easier to learn programming and how things work.
