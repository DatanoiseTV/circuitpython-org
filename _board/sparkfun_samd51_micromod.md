With a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4F MCU, the SparkFun MicroMod SAMD51 Processor Board is one powerful microcontroller packaged on a small board! The board provides you with an economical and easy to use development platform if you're needing more power with minimal working space. With the M.2 MicroMod connector, connecting your SAMD51 Processor is a breeze. Simply match up the key on your processor's beveled edge connector to the key on the M.2 connector and secure it with a screw (included with all Carrier Boards). The SAMD51 is one of the most powerful and economical microcontrollers available so to be able to add it to your MicroMod Carrier Board is a huge advantage for your project!

The ATSAMD51J20 utilizes a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4 processor with Floating Point Unit (FPU), running up to 120MHz, up to 1MB of flash memory, up to 256KB of SRAM with ECC, up to 6 SERCOM interfaces, and other features. This MicroMod SAMD51 even comes flashed with the same convenient UF2 bootloader like the SAMD51 Thing Plus and the RedBoard Turbo.
