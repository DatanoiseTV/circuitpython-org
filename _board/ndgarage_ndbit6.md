FeatherSnow is a decoration easy to program. It works out of the box.

FeatherSnow is powered by a SAMD21 from Microchip. There are 18 white LEDs that can be controlled independently. With a native USB and a built-in regulator, FeatherSnow comes with a UF2 bootloader and a small CircuitPython runtime. The SWD header is populated. FeatherSnow works with CircuitPython, Arduino and even C code.

This project is inspired by Jiří Praus' Arduinoflake and LuckyResistor's SnowFlakeProject.

Kudos to Adafruit for USB PID and easy CircuitPython.
